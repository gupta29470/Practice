Here weâ€™re allowed to stock shares at most twice. The idea is to use 
extra space to solve this problem. We create an auxiliary array 
(say profit[] ) and fill it while performing two scans of the input 
array which contains the stock price information for each day.

1. In the first scan, we update profit[i]  to the maximum profit earned 
by a single stock transaction from day i  to day n-1 . This can be done 
by traversing the array from right to left and keeping track of maximum 
stock price seen so far.

2. In the second scan, we update profit[i]  by taking the maximum of 
profit[i-1]  (i.e. maximum profit calculated so far) and the total 
profit obtained by closing the first transaction on day and performing 
another transaction from day i  to day n-1. . We can find the maximum 
profit earned on a stock transaction closing on day  by traversing the 
array from left to right and keeping track of minimum stock price seen
so far.

3. 
Finally, the last element of profit[]  has the result.

findMaxProfit function:
	-> create profit array of size input array to store max profit so far
	for each day
	
	-> first initialize max_so_far as last element of array
	
	-> for loop from second last element to 0 :
		-> update current profit index by checking max(previous profit,
		max_so_far - current price)
		
		update max_so_far by max(current max_so_far, current price)
		
	-> After this loop we have found 1st max profit of single transaction, 
	means max profit till now. Now we have to find 2nd max profit
	
	
	-> initialize min_so_far with first element of price
	
	-> for loop from 1 to n - 1:
		profit[index] = max(previous profit, current price - min_so_far
		+ profit associated with index i.e profit[index])
		
		update min_so_far by min(min_so_far , current price)
		
	return last element of profit array
