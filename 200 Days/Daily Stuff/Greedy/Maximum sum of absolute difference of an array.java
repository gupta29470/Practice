/*
To solve this problem, we have to think greedily that how can we maximize the difference 
value of the elements so that we can have a maximum sum. This is possible only if we 
calculate the difference between some very high values and some very low values like 
(highest â€“ smallest). This is the idea which we have to use to solve this problem. 
Let us see the above example, we will have maximum difference possible for sequence 
{1, 8, 2, 4} because in this sequence we will get some high difference values, 
( |1-8| = 7, |8-2| = 6 .. ). Here, by placing 8(highest element) in place of 1 and 2 
we get two high difference values. Similarly, for the other values, we will place next 
highest values in between other, as we have only one left i.e 4 which is placed at last.

Algorithm: To get the maximum sum, we should have a sequence in which small and large 
elements comes alternate. This is done to get maximum difference.

For the implementation of the above algorithm ->
1. We will sort the array.
2. Calculate the final sequence by taking one smallest element and largest element 
from the sorted array and make one vector array of this final sequence.
3. Finally, calculate the sum of absolute difference between the elements of the array.
